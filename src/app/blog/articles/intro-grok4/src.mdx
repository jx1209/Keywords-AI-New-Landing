Grok 4 is the July 2025 flagship model from xAI. It delivers a 256k token context window, built in tools, multimodal input, and an optional Heavy multi agent tier. API pricing is $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens (same as Grok 3). This guide covers capabilities, quick API setup, and how Grok 4 compares to current premium reasoning models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek.

## Overview of Grok 4

### Grok-4 Release & Variants

- Announced July 10, 2025 as xAI's most capable model targeting advanced reasoning and real time intelligence.
- Two variants: Grok 4 (single agent) and Grok 4 Heavy (parallel multi agent for complex jobs).

### Core API Specs

| Attribute                | Grok 4                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Context window           | 256 k tokens                                           |
| Pricing (per 1 M tokens) | \$3 input / \$15 output                                |
| Heavy subscription       | \$300 / month seat for multi-agent tier                |
| Modalities               | Text + images (vision endpoint); voice in mobile apps  |
| Tool use                 | Native web/X search & function calling                 | 


### Stand-out Features

* **Always-on chain-of-thought**: the legacy reasoning\_effort toggle is gone and every call runs in full reasoning mode.
* **Live search agent**: lets the model fetch current web or X posts during inference—no extra orchestration needed.
* **Structured outputs & function calling**: follow the OpenAI JSON schema standard.

## Grok API Access

### Getting Started with xAI API

Step 1: Create an xAI account at [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai) and generate your API key. Store it securely as an environment variable.

Step 2: Make your first API request following the [official tutorial](https://docs.x.ai/docs/tutorial#step-4-make-a-request-from-python-or-javascript).

Step 3: You can also use OpenAI or Anthropic SDK compatibility by changing the base URL.

```python
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
)

# Sending the query
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-4",
    messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Which ingredients do you notice on the picture?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Alternative: Using Keywords AI Gateway

You can also access Grok 4 through the **Keywords AI gateway**, which provides unified access to all mainstream AI models.([Library](https://www.keywordsai.co/llm-library)) We offer seamless compatibility with popular SDKs including OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, Mastra, and etc., making integration effortless regardless of your preferred development stack.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.keywordsai.co/api/",
    api_key=YOUR_KEYWORDSAI_API_KEY,
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    #Any models you would like to use.
    messages=[{"role":"user", "content":"Tell me a long story"}],
)
```

## When Grok 4 Is the Right Choice

| Prefer Grok 4 when…                                                       | Why                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| **You need ultra-long context** (legal transcripts, book-length prompts). | 256k tokens exceeds most competitors except Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1M window, ideal for comprehensive document analysis.        |
| **Real-time data or social feeds are critical.**                          | Native Live Search pulls current web & X results during inference—no external API orchestration needed.                   |
| **Advanced mathematical reasoning.**                                      | Heavy variant achieves 44.4% on Humanity's Last Exam and 100% on AIME 2025, outperforming most competitors.               |
| **Multi-agent collaboration is needed.**                                  | Heavy tier ($300/mo) runs parallel AI agents for complex problem-solving that single models can't handle effectively.     |
| **Cost-effective reasoning at scale.**                                    | $3/$15 pricing matches Claude 4 Sonnet but with always-on chain-of-thought and superior context window.                   |

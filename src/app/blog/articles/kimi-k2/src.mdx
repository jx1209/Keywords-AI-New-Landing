# Kimi K2 Explained: Specs, Benchmarks & How to Start Building for Developers

Moonshot AI's **Kimi K2** has entered the arena, and it's one of the most powerful open-weight models released to date. With **1 trillion parameters**, **128K token context**, and top-tier performance on coding and math tasks, Kimi K2 is quickly becoming a go-to choice for developers looking for a high-performing, low-cost alternative to GPT-4 and Claude.

In this guide, we’ll break down what makes Kimi K2 special, how it compares to other frontier models, and how you can start building with it today.

## What Is Kimi K2?

Kimi K2 is a **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** large language model developed by [Moonshot AI](https://moonshot.ai). It is the successor to the original Kimi Chat model and is designed to be fast, efficient, and open-weight—meaning developers can download the weights and run the model themselves.

At its core, K2 uses a MoE architecture with **1 trillion total parameters** and **32 billion active** at runtime, which means only a subset of the model is activated per query. This gives it both speed and scale.

## Key Specs at a Glance

* **Architecture:** MoE with 384 experts, 61 layers, 64 heads
* **Total Parameters:** 1 trillion (1T)
* **Active Parameters:** 32 billion (32B)
* **Context Window:** 128,000 tokens
* **Modalities:** Text-only (multimodal expected in future variants)
* **License:** Open-weight (non-commercial usage allowed)

## Benchmark Performance

Kimi K2 shines in reasoning, math, and especially coding tasks:

| Benchmark         | Score       | Comparison                    |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| **LiveCodeBench** | 53.7%       | #1 among open models          |
| **MATH 500**      | 97%+        | Near GPT-4.1                  |
| **HumanEval**     | Competitive | Beats many proprietary models |

These results put Kimi K2 in the same league as Claude Opus and GPT-4.1, particularly in agentic workflows and code generation.

## Pricing & Access Options (Available at Keywords AI Platform)

Kimi K2 is available via multiple hosting providers and offers extremely competitive rates:

| Provider        | Input \$/M | Output \$/M | Notes                |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| **OpenRouter**  | \$0.15     | \$2.50      | More options         |
| **DeepInfra**   | \$0.55     | \$2.20      | Public API           |
| **SiliconFlow** | \$0.58     | \$2.29      | 100K TPM limit       |
| **Together AI** | \$1.00     | \$3.00      | Easy quickstart code |

You can also run the model yourself with weights from Hugging Face or directly from Moonshot AI.

## Why Kimi K2 Matters

Kimi K2 isn’t just another big model. It’s part of a growing trend of **open-weight, high-performance LLMs** that offer developers real control and flexibility.

* **Open-weight:** Access the raw model files and run it locally or in your own infra.
* **Massive context:** 128K tokens lets you process entire books, transcripts, or long threads in one go.
* **Coding-first design:** K2 dominates in agentic coding tasks, competitive with proprietary options.
* **Cost-effective:** Underpricing most API-based models like GPT-4, Claude Opus, or Gemini.

## How to Start Building with Kimi K2

You can use Kimi K2 via hosted APIs (like OpenRouter) or self-host the model. Here’s how to start quickly:


### Option 1: Keywords AI Gateway

You can also Kimi K2 calls through [Keywords AI](https://www.keywordsai.co/) to monitor logs, costs, and trace executions across models.

### Option2: OpenRouter Example (Python)

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
client.chat.completions.create(
  model="moonshot/kimi-k2",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function to reverse a string."}]
)
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I download the Kimi K2 weights?**
A: Yes, the weights are available on Hugging Face and Moonshot's website.

**Q: Is Kimi K2 better than GPT-4o?**
A: GPT-4o still leads in general reasoning and multimodal.

**Q: Can I use Kimi K2 in production?**
A: Yes, but commercial use requires specific licensing. Check Moonshot's terms.
